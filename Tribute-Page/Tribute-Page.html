    <h3> What is the internet? </h3> </br>
    <p> While it may seem like a simple question, defining the Internet isn’t easy. Because unlike any other technology, the Internet can be whatever 
        we make it. We can shape it. We can mold it. But most importantly, we can use it to connect people, communities, and countries around the world. 
        The Internet has revolutionized the computer and communications world like nothing before. The invention of the telegraph, telephone, radio, and 
        computer set the stage for this unprecedented integration of capabilities. The Internet is at once a world-wide broadcasting capability, a 
        mechanism for information dissemination, and a medium for collaboration and interaction between individuals and their computers without regard for 
        geographic location.</p>

      <h3> What does the internet do?</h3>
      </br>
      <p> The Internet has one very simple job: to move computerized information (known as data) from one place to another. That's it! The machines 
          that make up the Internet treat all the information they handle in exactly the same way. In this respect, the Internet works a bit like the 
          postal service. Letters are simply passed from one place to another, no matter who they are from or what messages they contain. The job of 
          the mail service is to move letters from place to place, not to worry about why people are writing letters in the first place; the same 
          applies to the Internet.</p>

    </br>
     
    <p>Just like the mail service, the Internet's simplicity means it can handle many different kinds of information helping people to do many different
    jobs. It's not specialized to handle emails, Web pages, chat messages, or anything else: all information is handled equally and passed on in exactly 
    the same way. Because the Internet is so simply designed, people can easily use it to run new "applications"—new things that run on top of the basic 
    computer network. That's why, when two European inventors developed Skype, a way of making telephone calls over the Net, they just had to write a 
    program that could turn speech into Internet data and back again. No-one had to rebuild the entire Internet to make Skype possible.</p>

    <p id="tribute-info">The evolution of the Internet is happening now. More than just its infrastructure, how we use it and where we use it to connect 
        are in a state of continuous change.</br>
